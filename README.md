## Utilities

### Pytest
Pytest is an excellent tool to aid in testing. One of the most useful features in Pytest is the ability to create reusable fixtures that provide test methods with easy access to commonly used objects. Pytest also uses automatic test collection to search for and run any tests that it can find. Pytest-Django also provides a fixture called live_server which runs a django server in the background to provide a test environment. To access a return or yield value from a fixture, just add the fixture to an argument call and pytest will automatically use the matching fixture in that test. Below are the necessary imports and some of the pytest fixtures used by the following labs.

* Imports
```sh
import pytest
from django.core.management import call_command
from selenium import webdriver
```
* This fixture sets up the database for the testing session.
```sh
# scope variable determines how often to run the fixture. function is run once per each test function.
@pytest.fixture(scope='function', autouse=True)
def django_db_setup(django_db_setup, django_db_blocker):

   # Open database
   with django_db_blocker.unblock():

      # Wipe data
      call_command("flush", interactive=False)

      # Load default values
      call_command('loaddata', 'default.json')
```

* Fixture to initialize and yield a chromedriver for web navigation.
```sh
@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
def driver(live_server) -> webdriver.Chrome:
   # Create chromedriver instance
   driver = webdriver.Chrome()

   yield driver

   # End chromedriver instance
   driver.quit()
```

* Pytest comes with a lot of customizable options for logging already, but, while using selenium, we can create a fixture that takes a screenshot if the test fails or a command line argument was given.
```sh
# Automatically use on test start, but doesn't do anything until the test finishes.
@pytest.fixture(scope="function", autouse=True)
def screenshot(request, driver):
   # Test start

   yield

   # Test end

   # Get the name of the test function
   function_name = request.function.__name__

   # Take screenshot if --capture in command line arguments
   if request.config.getoption("--screenshot"):
      capture_screenshot(driver, function_name)

   # Take screenshot if test failed
   elif request.node.rep_call.failed:
      capture_screenshot(driver, function_name + "_actual")
```

## Labs

### Selenium
Selenium is a powerful, open-source framework that is popular for automating testing with web applications. The framework provides
the user with tools to navigate webpages and interact with them. It is capable to finding page elements through a variety of methods to which provides the ability to automatically test environments that may change frequently. Here is a list of some of the useful functions that selenium provides:
<br>
| Function     | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| driver.get | Navigates to specified url |
| driver.find_element(type, value) | Finds a webpage element using a selector type and selector value. |
| driver.find_elements(type, value) | Same as find element, except it will return multiple elements if there is more than one match. |
| element.text | Retrieves the visible text from a web element. |
| element.click() | Clicks on a given element. |
| element.send_keys(value) | Types a given value into an input element. |
| element.get_attribute(attribute_name) | Gets the value of a specific attribute of a web element. |
| element.clear() | Clears the selected input field. |
| driver.title | Returns the webpages title. |
| driver.current_url | Returns the url of the current webpage. |
| driver.close() | Closes current browser window. |
| driver.quit() | Quits the browser and closes all windows. |

To begin actual testing on a page with selenium, some additional imports are needed.

```sh
# Import libraries
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import Select
from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException
```
Now that we have fixtures in place and all the imports necessary to run selenium, we can create some utility functions to assist with webpage testing.
<br>

1. __navigate_to(driver, live_server, url)__ - Retrieve given url.
```sh
# Driver is from the fixture created earlier. Live_server is a fixture that's part of pytest-django and doesn't need to be created.
driver.get(live_server.url + url)
```
<br>

2. __find_element(driver, selector_type, selector_value)__ - Find and return a web element.
```sh
# Provides a little more flexibility for find_element and allows for variable selector types. 
element = None
match selector_type:
   case "id":
      element = driver.find_element(By.ID, selector_value)
   case "name":
      element = driver.find_element(By.NAME, selector_value)
   case "class":
      element = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, selector_value)
return element
```
<br>

3. __find_elements(driver, selector_type, selector_value)__ - Same as above except uses find_elements to return multiple elements.

<br>

4. __elements_exist(driver, elements)__ - Takes a dictionary argument and checks the page for all elements matching the key:value pairs.
```sh
# Loop over elements
for selector_type, selector_value in elements.items():

   # Use custom find_elements function to search for an element
   elements = find_elements(driver, selector_type, selector_value)

   # If no elements were found, return False
   if len(find_elements(driver, selector_type, selector_value)) == 0:
      return False

# Otherwise return True.
return True
```
<br>

5. __select(driver, selector_type, selector_value)__ - Select an option from a dropdown menu.
```sh
# Find the dropdown menu
dropdown = find_element(driver, selector_type, selector_value)

# Select an option from the menu
Select(dropdown).select_by_visible_text(selector_value)
```
<br>

6. __capture_screenshot(driver, file_name)__ - Capture a screenshot of the current page.
```sh
# Save a screen with a given file name in the auctions/static/tests directory.
driver.save_screenshot("auctions/static/tests/" + file_name + ".png")
```
<br>

7. __fill_form(driver, form_fields)__ - Takes a dictionary argument and uses the key:value pairs to find input elements on a form and insert values. With a slight modification to the dictionary values and function, this method could also utilize the custom find_element and allow for variable css selectors.
```sh
# Loop over dictionary items
for field_name, field_value in form_fields.items():

   # Search for element by name and insert value.
   driver.find_element(By.NAME, field_name).send_keys(field_value)
```
<br> 

8. __click(driver, selector_type, selector_value)__ - Clicks on a webpage element.
```sh
# Use custom find_element to get element 
element = find_element(driver, selector_type, selector_value)

# Click element
element.click()
```
<br>

9. __login(driver, live_server, form_fields)__ - Combines above functions to log in a user.
```sh
# Navigate to page
navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/users/login")

# Enter login info
fill_form(driver, form_fields)

# Click login
click(driver, "name", "login")
```

Now that selenium is ready and the utility functions are made, here are some examples using selenium tools in webpage testing:

<br>

__Validate Registration Form Fields__: Verify all necessary form fields exist on the page.
```sh
# Form fields to check for
form_fields = {"name":"username","name":"email","name":"password","name":"confirmation","name":"register"}
```
```sh
# Navigate to registration form page.
navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/users/register")
```
```sh
# Search for element by html name field and verify form fields exist
assert elements_exist(driver, form_fields)
```
Expected Result: All elements found.

<br>


__Test Login__ - Verify that user with valid credentials can log in.
```sh
# Login as User
login(driver, live_server, LOGIN_USER_FORM_FIELDS)

# Verify expected greeting on index
expected = "Welcome, User."  # Output is Welcome, <username>, but the test user is User.

# Use .text to retrieve the visible text from page greeting
greeting = find_element(driver, "id", "greeting").text
assert greeting == expected
```
Expected Result: Logged in as User with appropriate greeting.

<br>


__Test Category Dropdown__ - Verify that category dropdown selection redirects user to the proper page.
```sh
# Check if category dropdown exists
assert elements_exist(driver, {"name":"category"})

# Select a category
select(driver, "name", "category")

# submit choice
click(driver, "id", "category-select")

# Verify page loads with right category
auctions = find_elements(driver, "class", "item-name")
assert len(auctions) == 4

# Verify items match category
items = ["Fossil Watch", "Golden Hour Watch", "Casio Watch", "Timex Watch"]
for auction in auctions:
   assert auction.text in items
```
Expected Result: Page results return only the selected category.

<br>


__Test bid display__ - Verify that auctions accept valid bids and display a message if the user is currently winning the bid.
```sh
# Navigate to auction to bid on
navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/listing/1")

# Verify notification of winning bid is not currently displayed.
assert find_element(driver, "id", "bid_notification").text == "New Bid"

# Get minimum bid amount needed
bid = find_element(driver, "id", "bid")

# Use get_attribute to get the placeholder value, which is the minimum valid bid amount.
min_bid = bid.get_attribute("placeholder")

# Enter bid
bid.send_keys(min_bid)

# Submit bid
click(driver, "id", "submit_bid")

# Verify notification of user winning bid is displayed.
assert find_element(driver, "id", "bid_notification").text == "Currently winning bid."
```
Expected result: Bid is placed and the user sees notification that they are winning the bid.
<br>

__Test login redirect__ - Verify that logged in users who visit the log in page are redirected to the index.
```sh
# Log in user
login(driver, live_server, LOGIN_USER_FORM_FIELDS)

# Navigate to log in page
navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/users/login")

# Check url after redirect
assert live_server.url + "/index" == driver.current_url
```
Expected result: User redirected to index.

<br>

__Test Listings__ - Verifies that auction listings show on index page and provides a screenshot to compare with expected results if it fails.
```sh
# Navigate to index
    navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/index")
```
```sh
 # Check for auction listing containers
    assert elements_exist(driver, {"class":"item-container"})
```
Expected result: Item containers for auction listings exist.

__Test URL Titles__ - Load each page and verify URL titles match expected value.
```sh
# List of pages to check
   url_titles = [{"/users/register":"Registration"}, {"/users/login":"Log In"}, {"/index":"Auctions"}, {"/watchlist":"Watchlist"}
                  , {"/add_listing":"Add Listing"}, {"/category/shoes":"Shoes"}]
```
```sh
for index, item in enumerate(url_titles):  
   # Compare expected and actual titles
   url, title = item.popitem()
   navigate_to(driver, live_server, url)
   assert title in driver.title
```
```sh
# log in after viewing registration and log in pages
if index == 1:
   login(driver, live_server, LOGIN_USER_FORM_FIELDS)
```
Expected result: All webpage titles match the expected value.

## Behavior Driven Development

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development methodology that focuses on improving communication and collaboration between different stakeholders involved in the software development process. It also consist of three phases

1. Discovery phase: Product Owner or Product Manager creates acceptance criteria that will be used for scenarios/stories.
2. Formulation phase: During the formulaion phase, acceptance criteria is turned into acceptance test.
3. Automation phase: Acceptance test is to ran continuously and validates that the new behavior implements into the system with no problems.

Writing BDD scenarios is a fundamental aspect of Behavior-Driven Development

Scenario Example 
```sh
@registration

Feature: Register new user
  In order to participate in autions
  Users should have to login
  Using valid credentials

Scenario: User successfully registers using valid credentials
  Given user is on the registration page
  When the user enters a valide username, email, and password
  Then user is successfully registered
```

Behavior Driven Development helps to bridge the gap between software development and stakeholders by promoting collaboration

- **Authentication:** Offers straightforward handling of various authentication mechanisms like Basic Authentication, OAuth, etc.

Overall, the `requests` library is widely used in Python for its simplicity, flexibility, and comprehensive documentation, making it a preferred choice for working with HTTP and web APIs.

# Python Requests Library Lab for Testing Ecommerce APIs

## Install Required Package

Ensure you have the `requests` library installed. If not, install it using:

```bash
pip install requests
```
## Create a Test Script

Create a new Python script( e.g., 'ecommerce_api_test.py') in the same directory as your Ecommerce application.

```python
import requests

# Set the base URL for your Ecommerce Flask application
base_url = 'http://localhost:8000'  # Replace with your Ecommerce app's URL

def test_home_endpoint():
    response = requests.get(f'{base_url}/')
    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert response.text == 'Welcome to Our Ecommerce Site'  # Update with your Ecommerce site's welcome message

# Add other test functions similar to the provided lab example

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Run your test functions
    test_home_endpoint()
    # Add other test function calls here for your Ecommerce app's endpoints
```
## Run the Test Script

Open your terminal, navigate to the director containing your Ecommerce application and the new Python script ('ecommerce_api_test.py'), and run:

```python
python ecommerce_api_test.py
```
Ensure that your Ecommerce application is running ('python run.py') while exeecuting the tests.

### Test-Driven Development (TDD):

**What is TDD?**

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation. While doing TDD you want to write the smallest amount of code possible that causes a failing test, then write code to make the test pass. It follows a cycle of writing tests, writing code to pass those tests, and then refactoring the code while ensuring all tests still pass. Here are some examples of features being added by using TDD:

__User log in remember me checkbox__ - Saves a session for the user to skip log in when they visit the site.
1. Search for checkbox that doesn't exist yet.
```sh
def test_remember_me(driver):
    checkbox = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "remember_me")
```
2. Add checkbox to the page.
```sh
<input type="checkbox" name="remember_me">Remember Me
```
3. Login with checkbox ticked.
```sh
# Tick checkbox
checkbox.click()
# Login User
driver.find_element(By.NAME, "username").send_keys("User")
driver.find_element(By.NAME, "password").send_keys("testuser1")
driver.find_element(By.NAME, "login").click()
```
4. Reload page and check welcome greeting.
```sh
# Close page and reopen browser
driver = reload_page(driver, "http://127.0.0.1:8000")
# Check User greeting
greeting = driver.find_element(By.ID, "greeting")
assert greeting.text == "Welcome, User."
```
5. After confirming the test fails again, add a check in the django view for the remember_me checkbox.
```sh
if not "remember_me" in request.POST:
   request.session.set_expiry(0)
```
6. Function after refactoring the program. Added utility functions to make the code more readable and reusable. Changed the method to find expiration by checking the cookies.
```sh
# Navigate to login
navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/users/login")

# Click checkbox
click(driver, "name", "remember_me")

# Login User
fill_form(driver, LOGIN_USER_FORM_FIELDS)
click(driver, "name", "login")

# Check that cookie won't expire on browser close
assert get_cookie_expiration_time(driver, "sessionid") > 0
```
* The helper function used for this test:
```sh
def get_cookie_expiration_time(driver, cookie_name):
   # Get all cookies
   cookies = driver.get_cookies()

   # Find the specific cookie by name
   target_cookie = next((cookie for cookie in cookies if cookie["name"] == cookie_name), None)

   # Extract and return the expiration time of the cookie
   if target_cookie:
      if "expiry" in target_cookie:
         return target_cookie["expiry"]

   return 0
```
Expected outcome: User sessions expires immediately when closing browser unless remember me is checked.


__Add API entry point__ - Adds a new API entry point to http://127.0.0.1:8000/get to get auction information.
1. Import requests library
```sh
import requests
```
2. Send API request
```sh
# Create request
url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/auctions"
params = {"get":1}
# Send request
response = requests.get(url, params=params)
```
3. Verify server response, which should currently return 404.
```sh
# Check status code to verify response
assert response.status_code == 200    
```
4. Add new view to django to handle the API requests.
```sh
# Create view
def get_auction(request):
    return JsonResponse({})
```
```sh
# Add view to urlpatterns
path("auctions", views.get, name="get")
```
5. Now that the API point exists, we need to check that the returned data is valid.
```sh
# Get the data from the response
data = response.json()
# Check data for valid info
assert data["pk"] == 1
```
6. Currently the page returns nothing, so next we add code to the view to search for the selected auction and return the data.
```sh
# Update django view, grabs data from model and converts to a json response.
data = serialize('json', AuctionListing.objects.filter(pk=request.GET.get("pk")))[1:-1]
json_data = json.loads(data)
return JsonResponse(json_data)
```
Expected outcome: Page successfully returns auction item where primary key = 1.

__Winning Bid Display__ - Shows the user viewing an auction if their bid is currently the top bid.
1. Navigate to an auction as a logged in user.
```sh
# Navigate to page
user_driver.get("http://127.0.0.1:8000/listing/1")
```
2. Verify notification of winning bid is not already displayed.
```sh
assert user_driver.find_element(By.ID, "bid_notification") == "New Bid"
```
3. Place a new bid
```sh
# Get minimum bid necessary to bid on item
bid = user_driver.find_element(By.ID, "bid")
min_bid = bid.get_attribute("placeholder")
# Enter new bid
bid.send_keys(min_bid)
# Submit bid
user_driver.find_element(By.ID, "submit_bid").click()
```
4. Check for updated bid notification, which fails the current assertion.
```sh
assert user_driver.find_element(By.ID, "bid_notification") == "Currently winning bid."
```
5. Update django template to display if user is winning the bid and run the test again.
```sh
# Update template to show if current user is winning the auction bid
{% if request.user == bid.username %}
   <label for="bid" id="bid_notification">Currently winning bid.</label>
{% else %}
   <label for="bid" id="bid_notification">New Bid</label>
{% endif %}
```
6. Function after refactoring.
```sh
# Log in user
login(driver, live_server, LOGIN_USER_FORM_FIELDS)

# Navigate to auction to bid on
navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/listing/1")

# Verify notification of winning bid is not currently displayed.
assert find_element(driver, "id", "bid_notification").text == "New Bid"

# Get minimum bid amount needed
bid = find_element(driver, "id", "bid")
min_bid = bid.get_attribute("placeholder")

# Enter bid
bid.send_keys(min_bid)
# Submit bid
click(driver, "id", "submit_bid")

# Verify notification of user winning bid is displayed.
assert find_element(driver, "id", "bid_notification").text == "Currently winning bid."
```
Expected outcome: After placing a new bid, the bid label displays notification that the user is winning the bid.
