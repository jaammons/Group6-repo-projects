## Utilities

### Pytest

Pytest is an excellent tool to aid in testing. One of the most useful features in Pytest is the ability to create reusable fixtures that provide test methods with easy access to commonly used objects. Pytest also uses automatic test collection to search for and run any tests that it can find. Pytest-Django also provides a fixture called live_server which runs a django server in the background to provide a test environment. To access a return or yield value from a fixture, just add the fixture to an argument call and pytest will automatically use the matching fixture in that test. Below are the necessary imports and some of the pytest fixtures used by the following labs.

- Imports

```python
import pytest
from django.core.management import call_command
from selenium import webdriver
```

- This fixture sets up the database for the testing session.

```python
# scope variable determines how often to run the fixture. function is run once per each test function.
@pytest.fixture(scope='function', autouse=True)
def django_db_setup(django_db_setup, django_db_blocker):

   # Open database
   with django_db_blocker.unblock():

      # Wipe data
      call_command("flush", interactive=False)

      # Load default values
      call_command('loaddata', 'default.json')
```

- Fixture to initialize and yield a chromedriver for web navigation.

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)
def driver(live_server) -> webdriver.Chrome:
   # Create chromedriver instance
   driver = webdriver.Chrome()

   yield driver

   # End chromedriver instance
   driver.quit()
```

- Pytest comes with a lot of customizable options for logging already, but, while using selenium, we can create a fixture that takes a screenshot if the test fails or a command line argument was given.

```python
# Automatically use on test start, but doesn't do anything until the test finishes.
@pytest.fixture(scope="function", autouse=True)
def screenshot(request, driver):
   # Test start

   yield

   # Test end

   # Get the name of the test function
   function_name = request.function.__name__

   # Take screenshot if --capture in command line arguments
   if request.config.getoption("--screenshot"):
      capture_screenshot(driver, function_name)

   # Take screenshot if test failed
   elif request.node.rep_call.failed:
      capture_screenshot(driver, function_name + "_actual")
```

## Labs

### Selenium

Selenium is a powerful, open-source framework that is popular for automating testing with web applications. The framework provides
the user with tools to navigate webpages and interact with them. It is capable to finding page elements through a variety of methods to which provides the ability to automatically test environments that may change frequently. Here is a list of some of the useful functions that selenium provides:
<br>
| Function | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| driver.get | Navigates to specified url |
| driver.find_element(type, value) | Finds a webpage element using a selector type and selector value. |
| driver.find_elements(type, value) | Same as find element, except it will return multiple elements if there is more than one match. |
| element.text | Retrieves the visible text from a web element. |
| element.click() | Clicks on a given element. |
| element.send_keys(value) | Types a given value into an input element. |
| element.get_attribute(attribute_name) | Gets the value of a specific attribute of a web element. |
| element.clear() | Clears the selected input field. |
| driver.title | Returns the webpages title. |
| driver.current_url | Returns the url of the current webpage. |
| driver.close() | Closes current browser window. |
| driver.quit() | Quits the browser and closes all windows. |

To begin actual testing on a page with selenium, some additional imports are needed.

```python
# Import libraries
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import Select
from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException
```

Now that we have fixtures in place and all the imports necessary to run selenium, we can create some utility functions to assist with webpage testing.
<br>

1. **navigate_to(driver, live_server, url)** - Retrieve given url.

```python
# Driver is from the fixture created earlier. Live_server is a fixture that's part of pytest-django and doesn't need to be created.
driver.get(live_server.url + url)
```

<br>

2. **find_element(driver, selector_type, selector_value)** - Find and return a web element.

```python
# Provides a little more flexibility for find_element and allows for variable selector types.
element = None
match selector_type:
   case "id":
      element = driver.find_element(By.ID, selector_value)
   case "name":
      element = driver.find_element(By.NAME, selector_value)
   case "class":
      element = driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, selector_value)
return element
```

<br>

3. **find_elements(driver, selector_type, selector_value)** - Same as above but can return multiple elements.

<br>

4. **elements_exist(driver, elements)** - Takes a dictionary argument and checks the page for all elements matching the key:value pairs.

```python
# Loop over elements
for selector_type, selector_value in elements.items():

   # Use custom find_elements function to search for an element
   elements = find_elements(driver, selector_type, selector_value)

   # If no elements were found, return False
   if len(find_elements(driver, selector_type, selector_value)) == 0:
      return False

# Otherwise return True.
return True
```

<br>

5. **select(driver, selector_type, selector_value)** - Select an option from a dropdown menu.

```python
# Find the dropdown menu
dropdown = find_element(driver, selector_type, selector_value)

# Select an option from the menu
Select(dropdown).select_by_visible_text(selector_value)
```

<br>

6. **capture_screenshot(driver, file_name)** - Capture a screenshot of the current page.

```python
# Save a screen with a given file name in the auctions/static/tests directory.
driver.save_screenshot("auctions/static/tests/" + file_name + ".png")
```

<br>

7. **fill_form(driver, form_fields)** - Takes a dictionary argument and uses the key:value pairs to find input elements on a form and insert values. With a slight modification to the dictionary values and function, this method could also utilize the custom find_element and allow for variable css selectors.

```python
# Loop over dictionary items
for field_name, field_value in form_fields.items():

   # Search for element by name and insert value.
   driver.find_element(By.NAME, field_name).send_keys(field_value)
```

<br>

8. **click(driver, selector_type, selector_value)** - Clicks on a webpage element.

```python
# Use custom find_element to get element
element = find_element(driver, selector_type, selector_value)

# Click element
element.click()
```

<br>

9. **login(driver, live_server, form_fields)** - Combines above functions to log in a user.

```python
# Navigate to page
navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/users/login")

# Enter login info
fill_form(driver, form_fields)

# Click login
click(driver, "name", "login")
```

Now that selenium is ready and the utility functions are made, here are some examples using selenium tools in webpage testing:

<br>

**Validate Registration Form Fields**: Verify all necessary form fields exist on the page.

```python
# Form fields to check for
form_fields = {"name":"username","name":"email","name":"password","name":"confirmation","name":"register"}
```

```python
# Navigate to registration form page.
navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/users/register")
```

```python
# Search for element by html name field and verify form fields exist
assert elements_exist(driver, form_fields)
```

Expected Result: All elements found.

<br>

**Test Login** - Verify that user with valid credentials can log in.

```python
# Login as User
login(driver, live_server, LOGIN_USER_FORM_FIELDS)

# Verify expected greeting on index
expected = "Welcome, User."  # Output is Welcome, <username>, but the test user is User.

# Use .text to retrieve the visible text from page greeting
greeting = find_element(driver, "id", "greeting").text
assert greeting == expected
```

Expected Result: Logged in as User with appropriate greeting.

<br>

**Test Category Dropdown** - Verify that category dropdown selection redirects user to the proper page.

```python
# Check if category dropdown exists
assert elements_exist(driver, {"name":"category"})

# Select a category
select(driver, "name", "category")

# submit choice
click(driver, "id", "category-select")

# Verify page loads with right category
auctions = find_elements(driver, "class", "item-name")
assert len(auctions) == 4

# Verify items match category
items = ["Fossil Watch", "Golden Hour Watch", "Casio Watch", "Timex Watch"]
for auction in auctions:
   assert auction.text in items
```

Expected Result: Page results return only the selected category.

<br>

**Test bid display** - Verify that auctions accept valid bids and display a message if the user is currently winning the bid.

```python
# Navigate to auction to bid on
navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/listing/1")

# Verify notification of winning bid is not currently displayed.
assert find_element(driver, "id", "bid_notification").text == "New Bid"

# Get minimum bid amount needed
bid = find_element(driver, "id", "bid")

# Use get_attribute to get the placeholder value, which is the minimum valid bid amount.
min_bid = bid.get_attribute("placeholder")

# Enter bid
bid.send_keys(min_bid)

# Submit bid
click(driver, "id", "submit_bid")

# Verify notification of user winning bid is displayed.
assert find_element(driver, "id", "bid_notification").text == "Currently winning bid."
```

<br>

**Test login redirect** - Verify that logged in users who visit the log in page are redirected to the index.

```python
# Log in user
login(driver, live_server, LOGIN_USER_FORM_FIELDS)

# Navigate to log in page
navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/users/login")

# Check url after redirect
assert live_server.url + "/index" == driver.current_url
```

<br>

**Test Listings** - Verifies that auction listings show on index page and provides a screenshot to compare with expected results if it fails.

```python
# Navigate to index
    navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/index")
```

```python
 # Check for auction listing containers
    assert elements_exist(driver, {"class":"item-container"})
```

Expected result: Item containers for auction listings exist.

**Test URL Titles** - Load each page and verify URL titles match expected value.

```python
# List of pages to check
   url_titles = [{"/users/register":"Registration"}, {"/users/login":"Log In"}, {"/index":"Auctions"}, {"/watchlist":"Watchlist"}
                  , {"/add_listing":"Add Listing"}, {"/category/shoes":"Shoes"}]
```

```python
for index, item in enumerate(url_titles):
   # Compare expected and actual titles
   url, title = item.popitem()
   navigate_to(driver, live_server, url)
   assert title in driver.title
```

```python
# log in after viewing registration and log in pages
if index == 1:
   login(driver, live_server, LOGIN_USER_FORM_FIELDS)
```

Expected result: All webpage titles match the expected value.

## Behavior Driven Development

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development methodology that focuses on improving communication and collaboration between different stakeholders involved in the software development process. It also consist of three phases

1. Discovery phase: Product Owner or Product Manager creates acceptance criteria that will be used for scenarios/stories.
2. Formulation phase: During the formulaion phase, acceptance criteria is turned into acceptance test.
3. Automation phase: Acceptance test is to ran continuously and validates that the new behavior implements into the system with no problems.

Writing BDD scenarios is a fundamental aspect of Behavior-Driven Development

### Gherkin Language

In BDD Scenarios are designed to illustrate a specific aspect of a behavior of the application. The words Given, When, Then, and And are often used to help drive out the scenarios (And repeats the type of step preceding it and is optional to create more naturally written scenarios). Gherkin helps developers and QA engineers clarify the requirements by breaking them into specific examples. Gherkin is used by Behave and many other tools. Tests are split up based on the feature you are testing and the specific scenario within that feature being tested.

Feature Example

```sh
Feature: User Management
    Scenario: User logs in
        Given the user has valid log in credentials
        When the user goes to users/login
        And the user fills out login form
        And the user clicks on element with name login
        Then the user is taken to index
        And the user greeting is Welcome, User.

    Scenario: User logs out
        Given the user is logged in
        When the user clicks on element with id logout
        Then the user is taken to index
        And the user greeting is Not signed in.
    
    Scenario: New user registers
        Given the user has valid registration information
        When the user goes to users/register
        And the user fills out registration form
        And the user clicks on element with name register
        Then the user is taken to index
        And the user greeting is Welcome, RegistrationTest.
        
    Scenario: User goes to log in page after being authenticated
        Given the user is logged in
        When the user goes to users/login
        Then the user is taken to index

    Scenario: User checks the information needed to register
        Given the user is on index
        When the user goes to users/register
        Then the user can see element with name username
        And the user can see element with name email
        And the user can see element with name password
        And the user can see element with name confirmation
```

And the code to implement each scenario:
__User logs in__:
```sh
# Given the user has valid log in credentials
@given(u'the user has {item}')
def step_user_has(context, item: str) -> None:
    match item:
        case "valid log in credentials":

# When the user goes to users/login
@when(u'the user goes to {url}')
def step_user_navigates_to(context, url: str) -> None:
    context.driver.get("http://127.0.0.1:8000/" + url)

# And the user fills out registration form

Behavior Driven Development helps to bridge the gap between software development and stakeholders by promoting collaboration, BDD is an understanding of how a product is intended to work by communication witht eh customer(s), developers, and managers. 

**Advantages of BDD**:
- Customer-Driven Product Development: The feedback of the cusztomer from the beginning helps ensure high efficiency and requirements are meet.
- Proper Prioritization of features: By learning about the customer needs, the developers are able to identify which features have higher priority to others. Features that are required for the business such as financial ones can be tested, implemented, and delivered first.
- Greater Transparency: For everone to be okay with what is going to be implemented in the code, transparency is something that BDD does best as it ensures a constant update of what is currently happneing so that the project goes in the right direciton.
- Reduced maintenance and project risk: Because of BDD compnanies lower the risks of software development by optimizing features and checking for failiures in the code.

**Cucumber in BDD**:
  1. Cucumber is a testing framework that is written with Ruby, it is open source.
  2. It allows developers to write a variety of tests cases by outlining, defining, and documenting Gherkin.

**SpecFlow in BDD**:
  1. A framework that is similar to Cucumber but it is based on Ruby and hosted on GitHub.
  2. It is also an open source framework that accepts test driver development which facilitates the collaboration between team members.

# Python Requests Library Lab for Testing Ecommerce APIs

## Install Required Package

Ensure you have the `requests` library installed. If not, install it using:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Create a Test Script

Create a new Python script( e.g., 'api_test.py') in the same directory as your Ecommerce application.

1. This test performs the welcome test we did in postman, but using the python requests library.

```python
import requests
# Set the base URL for your Ecommerce Django application
base_url = 'http://localhost:8000'  # Replace with your Ecommerce app's URL

def test_welcome(live_server):
   # Get server response from endpoint
   response = requests.get(live_server.url + "/welcome")

   # Verify server status
   assert response.status_code == 200

   # Verify response
   assert response.text == 'Welcome to Our Ecommerce Site!'
```

2. API registration test - Validates function to create users through the API.

```python
   # Import json to handle json responses
   import json
   def test_registration(live_server):
      # Send a post request with the user info to add
      response = requests.post(live_server.url + "/users/register_user", data=REGISTRATION_FORM_FIELDS)

      # Verify server status code
      assert response.status_code == 200

      # Get the data from the response
      data = json.loads(response.json())

      # Verify success message
      assert data["Success"] == "New user created."
```

3. Cookie test - Verifies that cookies are still delicious. Sends a get request to the server and examines the cookie obtained in response.

```python
def test_cookies(live_server):
   # Send get request
   response = requests.get(live_server.url + "/users/get_cookie")
   # Receive response
   cookie_monster_says = response.cookies["cookie"][1:-1]
   # Verify cookie value
   assert cookie_monster_says == "COOKIE! Om nom nom nom."
```

## Run the Test Script

Open your terminal, navigate to the director containing your Ecommerce application and the new Python script ('api_test.py'), and run:

```python
pytest api_test.py
```

### Test-Driven Development (TDD):

**What is TDD?**

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the actual code implementation. While doing TDD you want to write the smallest amount of code possible that causes a failing test, then write code to make the test pass. It follows a cycle of writing tests, writing code to pass those tests, and then refactoring the code while ensuring all tests still pass.

**Why we do Test Driven Development**:
It helps developers find any errors in the logic of the code for any feature that is being tested, this improves the understanding of the code and how it will function.

![alt text](https://browserstack.wpenginepowered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/TDD-640x770.png)

Here are some examples of features being added by using TDD:

**User log in remember me checkbox** - Saves a session for the user to skip log in when they visit the site.

1. Search for checkbox that doesn't exist yet.

```sh
def test_remember_me(driver):
    checkbox = driver.find_element(By.NAME, "remember_me")
```

2. Add checkbox to the page.

```sh
<input type="checkbox" name="remember_me">Remember Me
```

3. Login with checkbox ticked.

```sh
# Tick checkbox
checkbox.click()
# Login User
driver.find_element(By.NAME, "username").send_keys("User")
driver.find_element(By.NAME, "password").send_keys("testuser1")
driver.find_element(By.NAME, "login").click()
```

4. Reload page and check welcome greeting.

```sh
# Close page and reopen browser
driver = reload_page(driver, "http://127.0.0.1:8000")
# Check User greeting
greeting = driver.find_element(By.ID, "greeting")
assert greeting.text == "Welcome, User."
```

5. After confirming the test fails again, add a check in the django view for the remember_me checkbox.

```sh
if not "remember_me" in request.POST:
   request.session.set_expiry(0)
```

6. Function after refactoring the program. Added utility functions to make the code more readable and reusable. Changed the method to find expiration by checking the cookies.

```sh
# Navigate to login
navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/users/login")

# Click checkbox
click(driver, "name", "remember_me")

# Login User
fill_form(driver, LOGIN_USER_FORM_FIELDS)
click(driver, "name", "login")

# Check that cookie won't expire on browser close
assert get_cookie_expiration_time(driver, "sessionid") > 0
```

- The helper function used for this test:

```sh
def get_cookie_expiration_time(driver, cookie_name):
   # Get all cookies
   cookies = driver.get_cookies()

   # Find the specific cookie by name
   target_cookie = next((cookie for cookie in cookies if cookie["name"] == cookie_name), None)

   # Extract and return the expiration time of the cookie
   if target_cookie:
      if "expiry" in target_cookie:
         return target_cookie["expiry"]

   return 0
```

Expected outcome: User sessions expires immediately when closing browser unless remember me is checked.

**Add API entry point** - Adds a new API entry point to http://127.0.0.1:8000/get to get auction information.

1. Import requests library

```sh
import requests
```

2. Send API request

```sh
# Create request
url = "http://127.0.0.1:8000/auctions"
params = {"get":1}
# Send request
response = requests.get(url, params=params)
```

3. Verify server response, which should currently return 404.

```sh
# Check status code to verify response
assert response.status_code == 200
```

4. Add new view to django to handle the API requests.

```sh
# Create view
def get_auction(request):
    return JsonResponse({})
```

```sh
# Add view to urlpatterns
path("auctions", views.get, name="get")
```

5. Now that the API point exists, we need to check that the returned data is valid.

```sh
# Get the data from the response
data = response.json()
# Check data for valid info
assert data["pk"] == 1
```

6. Currently the page returns nothing, so next we add code to the view to search for the selected auction and return the data.

```sh
# Update django view, grabs data from model and converts to a json response.
data = serialize('json', AuctionListing.objects.filter(pk=request.GET.get("pk")))[1:-1]
json_data = json.loads(data)
return JsonResponse(json_data)
```

Expected outcome: Page successfully returns auction item where primary key = 1.

**Winning Bid Display** - Shows the user viewing an auction if their bid is currently the top bid.

1. Navigate to an auction as a logged in user.

```sh
# Navigate to page
user_driver.get("http://127.0.0.1:8000/listing/1")
```

2. Verify notification of winning bid is not already displayed.

```sh
assert user_driver.find_element(By.ID, "bid_notification") == "New Bid"
```

3. Place a new bid

```sh
# Get minimum bid necessary to bid on item
bid = user_driver.find_element(By.ID, "bid")
min_bid = bid.get_attribute("placeholder")
# Enter new bid
bid.send_keys(min_bid)
# Submit bid
user_driver.find_element(By.ID, "submit_bid").click()
```

4. Check for updated bid notification, which fails the current assertion.

```sh
assert user_driver.find_element(By.ID, "bid_notification") == "Currently winning bid."
```

5. Update django template to display if user is winning the bid and run the test again.

```sh
# Update template to show if current user is winning the auction bid
{% if request.user == bid.username %}
   <label for="bid" id="bid_notification">Currently winning bid.</label>
{% else %}
   <label for="bid" id="bid_notification">New Bid</label>
{% endif %}
```

6. Function after refactoring.

```sh
# Log in user
login(driver, live_server, LOGIN_USER_FORM_FIELDS)

# Navigate to auction to bid on
navigate_to(driver, live_server, "/listing/1")

# Verify notification of winning bid is not currently displayed.
assert find_element(driver, "id", "bid_notification").text == "New Bid"

# Get minimum bid amount needed
bid = find_element(driver, "id", "bid")
min_bid = bid.get_attribute("placeholder")

# Enter bid
bid.send_keys(min_bid)
# Submit bid
click(driver, "id", "submit_bid")

# Verify notification of user winning bid is displayed.
assert find_element(driver, "id", "bid_notification").text == "Currently winning bid."
```

Expected outcome: After placing a new bid, the bid label displays notification that the user is winning the bid.

### Playwright:

An open-source library created by Microsoft that is used to test browswers and to scrape the web. This tool allows for cross-browser web automation, while supporting different types of tests like API, end-to-end, and component testing.

**Tools**:

- TraceViewer gets the information to find test errors, it adds snapshots, action explorer, screencast execution, etc.
- Codegen produces tests by learning the developer's code and saves them into any language.
- Inspector is a tool that allows for execution tests and logs.
**Languages Suported**:
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th >JavaScript </th>

      <th >C# </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
</table>

### Installation Steps for Playwright in Python

1. **Install Playwright:**

   Install the Playwright library using pip:

   ```sh
   pip install playwright
   ```

2. **Install a Browser:**

   Playwright supports multiple browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit). Install the browser(s) of your choice:

   ```sh
   playwright install
   ```

   This command will download the necessary browser binaries required by Playwright.

### Writing Tests with Playwright

1. **Import Playwright:**

   In your Python script, import Playwright:

   ```python
   from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
   ```

2. **Launch a Browser:**

   Use Playwright to launch a browser:

   ```python
   with sync_playwright() as p:
       browser = p.chromium.launch()
       context = browser.new_context()
       page = context.new_page()
   ```

    To simplify grabbing a page for each test, we can add some pytest fixtures. Adding these fixtures allows future test easy access to a browser or page by simply including them in the test arguments:
    ```python
    # Marks this as a fixture automatically used once for the current module being tested.
    @pytest.fixture(scope="module", autouse=True)
    def browser():
       # Specifically for django apps, this option allows async for playwright and live_server.
       os.environ["DJANGO_ALLOW_ASYNC_UNSAFE"] = "true"

       # Start playwright using with context to terminate it after tests
       with sync_playwright() as playwright:

          # Launch a browser
          browser = playwright.chromium.launch()

          # Yield browser and start tests
          yield browser

          # Test ends and clean up browser
          browser.close()

    @pytest.fixture
    def page(browser):
       # Create new browser environment
       context = browser.new_context()

       # Create new page to start web navigation
       page = context.new_page()

       yield page
    ```

4. **Navigate to a URL:**

   Direct the browser to a specific URL:

    ```python
    page.goto("http://127.0.0.1:8000/")
    ```
### Test 1: Verify Page Title

Objective: Ensure the page title matches the expected title.

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def test_page_title(live_server, page):    
        # Navigate to the specified URL
        page.goto(live_server.url)
        
        # Get the page title
        title = page.title()

        # Assert the title matches the expected title
        assert title == 'Auctions'
```

### Test 2: User Login

Objective: Simulate a user login by filling in the login form and verifying successful login.

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def test_user_login(live_server, page):
    # Navigate to the specified URL
    page.goto(live_server.url + "/users/login")
    
    # Fill the login form fields
    page.fill('input[name="username"]', 'User')
    page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'testuser1')
    
    # Submit the login form
    page.click('button[type="submit"]')
    
    # Wait for a specific element after login (if applicable)
    # page.wait_for_selector('#greeting')
    
    # Get the greeting message after successful login
    greeting_message = page.inner_text('#greeting')
    
    # Assert the greeting message confirms successful login
    assert greeting_message == 'Welcome, User.'
```
